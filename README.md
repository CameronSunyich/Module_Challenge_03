# Module_Challenge_03

## Overview of Election Audit:

Using this moduleâ€™s election_results.csv file, use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file. Provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods.

## Election-Audit Summary:

This code does have the potential to be used in other types of elections, with the caveat that the code is modified to run the voting result dataset. This code is simplified and easy to change to handle other election results. I would be hesitant to recommend this for national elections as the dataset might be too large to process. My recommendation would be to look into other programs for those larger datasets.

For smaller datasets, similar to the one currently being used, including other modifiers to the code would allow for better storytelling of the data. Introducing a classifier for the type of election race; state, county, and other. As well as a classifier for the political party each candidate aligns with; Republican, Democrat, Independent, and others. Implementing these classifiers would let auditors better understand the type of race and how the area may politically favor.
